Many of the domain science research activities that integrate cyberinfrastructure ultimately create knowledge systems. These knowledge systems facilitate the capture, management, and sharing of extant domain knowledge.

As such they are often referred to as socio-technical systems. Stakeholder alignment is a research approach that investigates the development of stakeholder alignment and the results from stakeholder alignment.

This project is a collaborative enterprise conducted by the participants in the Stakeholder Alignment Collaborative led by Joel-Cutcher-Gershenfeld at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University.
